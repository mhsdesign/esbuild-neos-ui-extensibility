# @mhsdesign/esbuild-neos-ui-extensibility

> note this package uses super internal top secret parts of the neos ui consumer api - use it on your own risk - as there was already a discussion to change the implementation to `Webpack 5 Federation` https://neos-project.slack.com/archives/C0U0KEGDQ/p1618805938027900

basically the alias resolution of @neos-project/neos-ui-extensibility as esbuild plugin.
